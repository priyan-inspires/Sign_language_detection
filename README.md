Project Title:

Real-Time Sign Language Detection System Using OpenCV

Project Overview:

The Real-Time Sign Language Detection System leverages computer vision and machine learning to enable seamless communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not. By detecting and interpreting hand gestures in real time, this project provides a practical solution for bridging communication barriers, enhancing inclusivity for hearing and speech-impaired individuals.

Key Features:
	1.	Real-Time Gesture Detection:
	•	Uses a webcam or camera to capture live video input.
	•	Identifies hand landmarks and gestures accurately.
	2.	Sign Language Interpretation:
	•	Maps detected gestures to corresponding alphabets, words, or phrases.
	•	Supports multiple predefined gestures for sign language alphabets.
	3.	User-Friendly Interface:
	•	Provides a clear text display of detected gestures.
	•	Designed for easy integration into various applications.
	4.	Open-Source Implementation:
	•	Developed using Python, OpenCV, and the cvzone library.
	•	Flexible for further development or customization.

Technologies Used:
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries:
	•	OpenCV (Computer Vision)
	•	cvzone (Landmark detection and gesture mapping)
	•	NumPy (Data processing)
	•	Machine Learning Model: Trained to recognize specific hand gestures.
	•	Hardware: Standard webcam or built-in camera.

Applications:
	•	Education: Helping teachers and students communicate effectively.
	•	Healthcare: Supporting communication between patients and medical staff.
	•	Public Services: Enhancing accessibility in customer support and service points.
	•	General Communication: Fostering inclusivity in daily interactions.

Future Scope:
	1.	Expanding gesture recognition to include complex sign phrases.
	2.	Adding multilingual support for different sign languages.
	3.	Integrating speech synthesis for voice output of detected gestures.
	4.	Enhancing model accuracy with deep learning algorithms.

This project aspires to make communication more inclusive and accessible while encouraging innovation in assistive technology.
